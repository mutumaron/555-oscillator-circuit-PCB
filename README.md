## 🧠 Overview

The 555 oscillator circuit is configured in **astable multivibrator mode**, where it continuously oscillates between high and low states.It is a relaxation oscillator.  
This design can be used in:
- LED flashers  
- Tone generation  
- Pulse width modulation (PWM)  
- Clock pulses for digital circuits
